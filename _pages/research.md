**Peer Effects in Entrepreneurship**, with Andrea Galeotti (LBS) and Adam Szeidl (CEU) (JMP)

We study how exposure to peers with entrepreneurship experience affects new entrepreneurship by exploiting quasi-random student assignment in an MBA program. Successful peers increase, while unsuccessful peers decrease successful entrepreneurship, by 15\% each, so that their combined effects cancel. Successful peers decrease unsuccessful entrepreneurship. These findings favor a model where students are uncertain about their business idea and successful peers are effective at screening. We structurally estimate this model and show that a policy of increasing meetings with entrepreneur peers need not affect successful entrepreneurship, but a policy of reallocating meetings to successful peers has large positive effects.

**Low Wages Aren't a Growing Problem**, with Simcha Barkai (BC)

[[Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4231412)] [[Slides](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nrzhcgvqbpj6l937z4syq/SimchaDavid_LowWages_David_Slides.pdf?rlkey=xxuywcf0vtv1yv0u5muk87smv&dl=0)]

Statements by high-pro le political gures and supporting academic research have led to a common perception of worsening job prospects for low-wage workers in the US. In this paper, we show that since the early 1980s there has been a decline in the share of workers earning low wages. This holds across sub-populations and across thresholds for determining what constitutes a low wage. Much of the decline occurs over two periods: the late 1990s and the late 2010s. The decline is greater and steadier for women than for men. We further show that the worker-level persistence of low wages has not increased, and has likely decreased, over time.
